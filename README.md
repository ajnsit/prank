**Build, bundle & ship your Rust WASM application to the web.**

**üì¶ Dev server** - Prank ships with a built-in server for rapid development workflows, as well as support for HTTP & WebSocket proxies.

**üèó Change detection** - Prank watches your application for changes and triggers builds for you, including automatic browser reloading.
